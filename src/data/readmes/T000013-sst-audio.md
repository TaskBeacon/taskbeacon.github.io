## 1. Task Overview

The Stop-Signal Task (SST) is a cognitive paradigm used to assess response inhibitionâ€”the ability to withhold an already-initiated action. In each trial, participants are instructed to respond to directional go stimuli (left or right arrows) by pressing the corresponding key. On a subset of trials, an auditory stop signal (a beep) sounds shortly after the go stimulus, indicating that the participant should inhibit their response. The delay between the go and stop signal (SSD) is adaptively adjusted to maintain a 50% stop success rate.

## 4. Methods (for academic publication)

Participants completed a stop-signal task (SST) designed to evaluate response inhibition. The task consisted of **3 blocks**, each containing **70 trials**, resulting in a total of **210 trials**. On each trial, participants saw a directional arrow (left or right) and were instructed to press the corresponding keyâ€”â€œFâ€?for left, â€œJâ€?for rightâ€”as quickly and accurately as possible. On **25% of the trials**, an auditory stop signal (a beep) was presented shortly after its onset, signaling the participant to inhibit their response. The delay between the go stimulus and the stop signalâ€”the stop-signal delay (SSD)â€”was controlled adaptively using a 1-up/1-down staircase procedure. The SSD increased after successful inhibition and decreased after failed inhibition, with a target success rate of 50%.Trials began with a fixation cross (0.8â€?.0s), followed by a go arrow. On go trials, the arrow remained on screen for up to 1 second or until a keypress. If no response occurred, a warning message was presented. On stop trials, the auditory stop signal was presented after an SSD-determined delay. Responses were recorded for both go and stop phases. The SSD was adjusted per trial based on inhibition performance. Participants received a break after each block, displaying their hit rate on go trials and success rate on stop trials.
