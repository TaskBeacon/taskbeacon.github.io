## 1. Task Overview

The Go/No-Go task is a cognitive paradigm used to assess response inhibition. In each trial, participants are presented with one of two stimuli: a "go" stimulus (a circle) or a "nogo" stimulus (a square). They are instructed to respond as quickly as possible to the "go" stimulus by pressing a key and to withhold their response to the "nogo" stimulus.

## 4. Methods (for academic publication)

Participants completed a Go/No-Go task designed to evaluate response inhibition. The task consisted of **3 blocks**, each containing **70 trials**, resulting in a total of **210 trials**. On each trial, participants saw either a circle ("go" stimulus) or a square ("nogo" stimulus). They were instructed to press a key as quickly and accurately as possible when they saw the circle and to withhold their response when they saw the square. On **75% of the trials**, the go stimulus was presented. Trials began with a fixation cross (0.8â€?.0s), followed by a go or nogo stimulus. The stimulus remained on screen for up to 1 second. If no response occurred on a go trial, a warning message was presented. Participants received a break after each block, displaying their accuracy for both go and nogo trials.
