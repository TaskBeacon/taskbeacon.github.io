## 1. Task Overview

This task implements a restless (drifting) two-armed bandit paradigm. Participants repeatedly choose between left and right options while reward probabilities drift across trials. The task measures adaptive choice behavior, exploration-exploitation balance, and reward-based learning in non-stationary environments.

## 2. Task Flow

### Block-Level Flow

| Step | Description |
|---|---|
| 1. Initialize runtime | Window, triggers, stimulus bank, condition-generation settings, and reward tracker are initialized. |
| 2. Show instructions | Task instruction page is displayed before trials begin. |
| 3. Prepare block drift path | Custom condition generation creates per-trial drifting reward probabilities and deterministic trial draws for the block. |
| 4. Execute block trials | Each trial records choice, RT, reward outcome, and cumulative score. |
| 5. Show block summary | Block statistics are displayed (choice ratio, hit rate, no-response ratio, block score). |
| 6. Show final summary | Final metrics are displayed and data are saved. |

### Trial-Level Flow

| Step | Description |
|---|---|
| Pre-choice fixation | Central fixation before choice. |
| Bandit choice | Left/right options are shown and choice is captured (`F/J`). |
| Choice confirmation | Selected option is highlighted briefly. |
| Outcome feedback | Reward/no-reward feedback with cumulative score. |
| Inter-trial interval | Fixation interval before the next trial. |

### Controller Logic

| Component | Logic |
|---|---|
| Architecture note | No adaptive controller object is used; block conditions are precomputed from `condition_generation` settings and runtime only consumes those trial specs. |
| Probability drift | Reward probabilities are updated each trial via Gaussian random walk (`drift_sigma`) and bounded to `[min_prob, max_prob]`. |
| Coupling | With `anti_correlated=true`, left and right probabilities drift in opposite directions. |
| Reward sampling | Bernoulli reward draw from current trial probabilities. |
| No-response policy | If no response occurs, a preplanned fallback side (generated from `no_choice_policy`) is used and `missed_choice=true` is logged. |

### Runtime Context Phases

| Phase Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `pre_choice_fixation` | Fixation before choice. |
| `bandit_choice` | Choice response window. |
| `choice_confirmation` | Selected-option confirmation stage. |
| `outcome_feedback` | Outcome feedback stage. |
| `iti` | ITI stage. |

## 4. Methods (for academic publication)

Participants completed repeated binary choices under non-stationary reward contingencies. Each trial contained fixation, choice, confirmation, and feedback stages, followed by an inter-trial interval. Reward probabilities changed continuously across trials via random walk dynamics.

The paradigm is designed to quantify adaptive learning under volatility. Trial logs include probabilities, responses, no-response imputations, reward outcomes, and cumulative score trajectories, enabling model-based analyses of exploration and exploitation strategies.

The implementation supports consistent `human`, `qa`, and `sim` execution pipelines with standardized responder context metadata.
