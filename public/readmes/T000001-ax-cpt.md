## 1. Task Overview
This task is an AX-Continuous Performance Test (AX-CPT) designed to assess cognitive control and context processing. Participants are presented with a series of letter pairs (cue followed by probe). They must make a specific target response only when the cue is an 'A' and the probe is an 'X' (AX trials). For all other combinations (AY, BX, BY), a different response (or no response) is required.

### Block-Level Flow
| Step | Description |
|---|---|
| 1. Instruction | Instructions are displayed at the beginning of the experiment. |
| 2. Trial Execution | Each block runs for a set number of trials, as defined in `config.yaml`. |
| 3. Block Break | After each block, a break screen is shown with the accuracy for the current block. |
| 4. Goodbye | After all blocks are complete, a "goodbye" message is displayed. |

### Trial-Level Flow
| Step | Description |
|---|---|
| 1. Fixation | A central fixation cross `(+)` is displayed. |
| 2. Cue Presentation | The cue letter (A or B) is presented. |
| 3. Inter-Stimulus Interval (ISI) Fixation | A central fixation cross `(+)` is displayed for a short duration. |
| 4. Probe Presentation & Response | The probe letter (X or Y) is presented, and the participant responds. |
| 4. Feedback | Feedback (`Correct`, `Incorrect`, or `Too Slow`) is displayed. |
| 5. Inter-Trial Interval (ITI) | A blank screen is shown before the next trial. |

## 4. Methods (for academic publication)
Participants perform an AX-CPT task, a continuous performance paradigm used to measure cognitive control and context processing. Each trial consists of a cue letter (A or B) followed by a probe letter (X or Y). Participants are instructed to press the 'f' key if the cue is 'A' and the probe is 'X' (AX trials). For all other cue-probe combinations (AY, BX, BY), they are instructed to press the 'j' key.

The task begins with a fixation cross, displayed for 500ms. The cue letter is then presented for 500ms, followed by a brief inter-stimulus interval (ISI) fixation of 500ms, and then the probe letter for up to 1000ms or until a response is made. Feedback (correct, incorrect, or no response) is provided for 500ms, followed by a randomized inter-trial interval between 800ms and 1200ms.

The task is structured into 4 blocks of 40 trials each (total 160 trials). Trial types (AX, AY, BX, BY) are presented in a weighted randomized order within each block (`AX=40%`, `AY=10%`, `BX=10%`, `BY=40%`) to preserve strong context expectancy while retaining critical low-frequency AY/BX control trials. This design allows for the examination of proactive and reactive cognitive control strategies.
