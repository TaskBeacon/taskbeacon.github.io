## 1. Task Overview

This task implements a risk-choice paradigm with three conditions:

- `gain_frame`: sure keep amount vs risky keep-all/keep-none option.
- `loss_frame`: sure loss amount vs risky full-loss/no-loss option.
- `mixed_frame`: sure amount vs mixed gain-loss lottery.

Each trial records choice, response latency, timeout status, and offer-level expected value metadata. Participant-facing text is Chinese and rendered with `SimHei`.

## 2. Task Flow

### Block-Level Flow

| Step | Description |
|---|---|
| 1. Block init | `Controller.start_block(block_i)` resets block metrics. |
| 2. Trial execution | `BlockUnit.run_trial(...)` runs one decision trial per schedule row. |
| 3. Block summary | Show block gamble rate, mean RT, and timeout count (except last block). |
| 4. Final summary | Show full-task gamble/RT metrics and condition-specific gamble rates. |

### Trial-Level Flow

| Step | Description |
|---|---|
| `fixation` | Present `+` for jittered fixation duration. |
| `decision` | Present framing label + scenario + safe/risky options; capture `f/j` response within deadline. |
| `feedback` | Show choice feedback or timeout feedback. |
| `iti` | Present jittered inter-trial fixation before next trial. |

### Controller Logic

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| Offer sampling | Samples one offer from condition-specific banks (`gain_trials`, `loss_trials`, `mixed_trials`). |
| Metrics update | Updates block/session gamble rate, timeout rate, and mean RT. |
| Condition stats | Tracks per-condition block and total metrics for reporting. |

### Runtime Context Phases

| Phase Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `fixation` | Pre-decision baseline display. |
| `decision` | Active choice window with valid keys. |
| `feedback` | Post-choice or timeout acknowledgement. |
| `iti` | Inter-trial reset period. |

## 3. Configuration Summary

### a. Subject Info

### c. Stimuli

| Stimulus Group | Description |
|---|---|
| `instruction_text` | Task instructions and key mapping. |
| `frame_label`, `scenario_text` | Condition label and scenario prompt. |
| `safe_option_text`, `gamble_option_text` | Left/right choice options shown simultaneously. |
| `key_hint` | On-screen reminder of safe/gamble key mapping. |
| `feedback_choice`, `feedback_timeout` | Response-dependent feedback text. |
| `fixation`, `block_break`, `good_bye` | Shared fixation and summary screens. |

### d. Timing

| Stage | Duration |
|---|---|
| fixation | jittered (`fixation_duration`) |
| decision | fixed deadline (`decision_deadline`) |
| feedback | fixed (`feedback_duration`) |
| iti | jittered (`iti_duration`) |

| `feedback_onset` | 40 |
| `iti_onset` | 50 |

### f. Controller Parameters

| Parameter Group | Description |
|---|---|
| `gain_trials` | Sure keep vs probabilistic keep-all offers. |
| `loss_trials` | Sure loss vs probabilistic full-loss offers. |
| `mixed_trials` | Sure amount vs mixed gain/loss lotteries. |
| `enable_logging` | Emits per-trial controller metrics to PsychoPy data log. |

## 4. Methods (for academic publication)

Participants performed a repeated risky-choice task under gain, loss, and mixed-outcome framing. On each trial they selected between a sure option and a gamble option using a two-key response mapping, under a bounded decision window. Trial-structured logs captured condition identity, offer parameters, expected-value fields, response choice, reaction time, and timeout events.

The implementation uses explicit phase instrumentation (`fixation`, `decision`, `feedback`, `iti`) with trigger-aligned event logging to support reproducible QA and downstream behavioral analysis of framing-dependent risk preference.
